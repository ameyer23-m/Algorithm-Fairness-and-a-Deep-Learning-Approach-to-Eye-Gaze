# Algorithm Fairness and a Deep Learning Approach to Eye Gaze
This project is part of my senior thesis that I created as part of my fullfilment for my Statistical and Data Science degree at the College of Wooster.
The project aims to explore the potential of Eye Gaze as a tool across various industries and develop a deep-learning model using the GazeCapture's eye gaze dataset and preexisting code to obtain predictions. The project investigates algorithm fairness metrics for the race and gender variables to ensure that the model does not discriminate against underrepresented groups within the dataset. I used various image processing methods such as RGB, grayscale, binarization, and edge detection to determine their effect on the algorithm's fairness. The results of the project indicate that the RGB image processing method is the most accurate method with a prediction error of 2.7165 cm for mobile devices. Additionally, I found that the Canny edge detection method and the intensity grayscale method result in fair gender algorithms. However, none of the image processing methods resulted in a fair race algorithm. Overall, this project highlights the potential of deep learning models to develop Eye Gaze technology while emphasizing the need for fairness in algorithmic decision-making.

The GazeCapture dataset and code can be found on their GitHub [here](https://github.com/CSAILVision/GazeCapture)

The Code will be added shortly...
